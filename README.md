# Small Games in JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of small games developed in pure JavaScript and some coding tries. These games were created as part of learning. Each game has its own directory. These games were created using free youtube tutorials.

To be able to run them, you have to:
- have IDEA (in my case I use Visual Studio Code)
